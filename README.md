# Group Rules

## a) Source Integrity & Reliability
- 1) Anchor all financial discussions in **trusted, authoritative sources**, such as Coinbase (for crypto), established financial news services (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Financial Times, YFinance), regulatory filings, or official disclosures.
- 2) Examples of unreliable sources include Discord, clickbait, titles like “Top 5 Altcoins to Buy Now,” U.Today, CryptoSlatem, NewsBTC, TikTok, most SOLO "influencers" on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. Official verified social media channels from reliable sources are OK.
- 3) No speculation without context—when discussing rumors or unverified news, **clearly label them as such** and cite your source.

## b) Scope of Discussion: Stick to Financial Relevance
- 1) Discussions must remain **on-topic**, focusing on market trends, risk analysis, etc.
- 2) Avoid political discussion **unless it directly and imminently affects investment or market fundamentals** (e.g., a newly passed tax law).  

## c) AI-Generated Content
- 1) If you use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or other assistants) to create or summarize content, **please clearly state that it is AI-generated**.  
- 2) AI can be helpful for drafting explanations or gathering references, but the **focus of this group is on human insight, interpretation, and learning from each other’s experience**.  
- 3) Use AI as a **supporting tool, not a substitute** for your own reasoning. Whenever possible, **add your personal analysis or perspective** alongside AI-generated contributions.

## d) Etiquette, Tone & Constructiveness
- 1) Be **respectful and courteous**: no insults, harassment, or ad hominem attacks.  
- 2) Encourage **constructive disagreement**—healthy debate is valuable when focused on ideas, not individuals.  
- 3) Stay **on-topic**—off-topic chatter should be kept to a minimum.

## e) Not Financial Advice
- 1) All conversations are **informational only** and do not constitute professional financial advice.  
- 2) Always **do your own due diligence** before making financial decisions.

## f) Transparency & Disclosures
- 1) If you have a **financial or vested interest** in a topic, **disclose it upfront**.  
- 2) No solicitation or promotion of products or services without clear disclosure and group relevance.  
- 3) Avoid conflicts of interest, or **state them clearly**, especially if sharing opinions that may impact markets or group discussions.

## g) Confidentiality & Privacy
- 1) Messages should ideally **stay within the group**. While this is more etiquette than a strict rule, respect the privacy of others.  
  2) If you wish to share someone else’s information, **ask for their permission first**.  
- 3) Avoid posting **personal or sensitive financial details** (yours or others’). If sharing account screenshots, **blur or black out balances** and other private data.

## h) Moderation, Reporting & Sanctions
- 1) It is expected that everyone will **abide by these rules out of courtesy and respect** for fellow members.  
- 2) If escalation is required, the process may include: **first warning → temporary mute → removal**.
